==============================================

 - Introduction

Qim - Qt ImageViewer is a lightweight image viewer based on Nokia's Qt - C++ Framework.
The viewer is also written in C++. In later states it arises an interface for building
plug-ins in other languages like Python maybe Java.

==============================================

 - Overview

The main software is designed for image representation only. What we aim at with this
tool is to appropriate a simple, fast and lightweight alternative for image representation
and in later states also image manipulation.

Qim should be able to handle the most important image formats maybe formats like .psd 
and raw for easy and fast access to the image information. If it's possible a layer engine
that handles the different layers of a psd file. Furthermore Qim should also be able to 
get access to EXIF data.

==============================================

 - Design aspects
 
Qim is a modular designed application which contains the main "ViewerCore" engine, a "Plug-in Manager"
engine and the "Theme Manager" engine.

ViewerCore 		- This is the basic engine which handles all image information, represents the image on screen,
				  implements a directory handler for navigation through all images of the currently selected 
				  directory and provides zooming features, printing options as well as drag and drop.
				  
				- The directory and imagedata handling is currently part of the ImageHandler object.
			 
Plug-in Manager - The plug-in manager provides an interface between the Core and the plug-ins.
				  The manager gets several features that realize the control of all valid plug-ins.
				  This part will be defined in a later state of development.

Theme Manager 	- The theme manager is responsible for the look and feel of Qim. Themes can be realized 
				  by style sheets. Therefore we will set up an default CSS theme file, which can be 
				  modified for different looks. 
				  The second part in the theme management is a more advanced GUI descriptor. With this
				  interface it is possible to chance the entire graphics interface.
				  The second part will also be defined in a later state of development.


==============================================

 - Qt itself is used in the LGPL v2.1
 
 !!Important!!
 Qim should be published under the LGPL or GPL. Which one has to be determined.
