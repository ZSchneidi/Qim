collection of known problems of Qim
---------------------------------------

on Windows 7:

	Windows is terminating Qim process on fast navigation
	but this happens in other application too.
	So this should be varify in other operation systems.
	Maybe it could be avoid by allowing navigation only if
	the last navigation step is done.
		But this could be a bit annoying.
